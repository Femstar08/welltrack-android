V 6.30.2025COMMUNICATING USE OF GARMIN DEVICE-SOURCED DATA OR APPS
Garmin apps should be communicated in marketing materials by using both the badge 
icon and messaging around its usage. A qualified designer should determine placement 
within materials, including websites, catalogs, advertisements and more.SAMPLE MESSAGING

SAMPLE MESSAGING
Acceptable: This chart was created using data provided by Garmin devices.
Acceptable: Insights derived in part from Garmin device-sourced data.
Acceptable: Model incorporates Garmin [device model] data.
Not acceptable: Garmin speed model. TITLE-LEVEL OR PRIMARY DISPLAYS
All uses of Garmin device-sourced data within dashboards, activity feeds, overview cards or summary views must include a “Garmin [device model]” attribution. This attribution ensures 
brand clarity and traceability. Access the device model information as instructed in the applicable API documentation. If the device model is not provided or unknown via the API, list 
Garmin as the data source. 
REQUIREMENTS
Position the Garmin attribution directly beneath or adjacent to the primary title or heading 
of the data view. The listing must be placed above the fold and always be visually 
associated with the data it supports, both in real-time views and exported visuals. Never 
bury the Garmin attribution in tooltips, footnotes or expandable containers.
The attribution can include the Garmin tag logo followed by the device model or simply 
be listed in appropriately sized text: “Garmin [device model].” If using the Garmin tag logo, 
access the files and follow the usage requirements in our Consumer Brand Style Guide . 
Do not alter or animate the Garmin tag logo. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in avatars, 
badges or unrelated imagery. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in instances where Garmin 
device-sourced data is not present.
SECONDARY SCREENS 
All uses of Garmin device-sourced data within detailed data views, reports, settings or historical views must include a “Garmin [device model]” attribution. This includes data views that 
display information such as heart rate, steps, Body Battery™ energy monitoring, etc. This attribution ensures brand clarity and traceability. Access the device model information as 
instructed in the applicable API documentation. If the device model is not provided or is unknown via the API, list Garmin as the data source. 
REQUIREMENTSGARMIN MARINE MAPPING EXAMPLE
List the Garmin attribution in all expanded views or subscreens. For multi-entry displays, 
you can apply the attribution globally — such as in a header — or per entry. Screenshots, 
printouts and reports must retain visible Garmin attribution.
The attribution can include the Garmin tag logo followed by the device model or simply 
be listed in appropriately sized text: “Garmin [device model].” If using the Garmin tag logo, 
access the files and follow the usage requirements in our Consumer Brand Style Guide . 
Do not alter or animate the Garmin tag logo. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in avatars, 
badges or unrelated imagery. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in instances where Garmin 
device-sourced data is not present.
DOWNSTREAM AND EXPORTED DATA
All commercial uses of Garmin device-sourced data that is shared, exported or transmitted beyond an application must include a Garmin attribution. This includes sharing data via file 
formats (such as CSVs or PDFs) or digital interfaces (such as APIs or webhooks). It is the developer’s responsibility to enforce downstream attribution in systems beyond its control 
through technical measures or contractual terms.
REQUIREMENTS
Include the Garmin attribution with the data listing at all times. In exports, the attribution 
must be adjacent to the data and repeated on each page. In APIs or webhook transfers, 
receiving systems must preserve attribution, and this should be outlined in a partner 
sublicense. In third-party visualizations, social media sharing or embedded experiences, 
the attribution must always remain visible. For multi-entry displays, you can apply the 
attribution globally — such as in a header or footer — or per entry.
COMBINED OR DERIVED DATA 
All uses of Garmin device-sourced data as an input to analytics, algorithms, machine learning models, artificial intelligence or combined, aggregated or blended with other sources — 
such as fitness apps, devices, third-party APIs or manual inputs — must include a Garmin attribution. This includes any use where the output is influenced materially by Garmin 
device-sourced data.
REQUIREMENTS
The attribution must list Garmin as a distinct or contributing data source (depending 
on what is true) and must not imply Garmin endorsement of data from other devices. 
For multi-entry displays, you can apply the attribution globally — such as in a header or 
footer — or per entry.
VISUAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA
All uses of Garmin device-sourced data as exports from third-party platforms into visual assets, such as social media images, infographics, maps or charts, must include a “Garmin [device 
model]” attribution. This attribution ensures brand clarity and traceability. Access the device model information as instructed in the applicable API documentation. If the device model is not 
provided or unknown via the API, list Garmin as the data source.
REQUIREMENTS
The Garmin attribution must be visible in every image. 
The attribution can include the Garmin tag logo followed by the device model or simply 
be listed in appropriately sized text: “Garmin [device model].” If using the Garmin tag logo, 
access the files and follow the usage requirements in our Consumer Brand Style Guide . 
Do not alter or animate the Garmin tag logo. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in avatars, 
badges or unrelated imagery. Do not use the Garmin tag logo in instances where Garmin 
device-sourced data is not present.GARMIN RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS FOR ATTRIBUTION COMPLIANCE.
