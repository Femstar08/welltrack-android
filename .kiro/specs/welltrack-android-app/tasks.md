### Task 32 (Final integration and optimization) → **Distributed across phases:**

- **Performance optimization** → Task 36 (Phase 1)
- **End-to-end testing** → Task 46 (Phase 5)
- **Deployment preparation** → Task 52 (Final Phase)
- **Module integration** → Tasks 40-42 (Phase 3)

### Task 33 (Compilation errors and build fixes) → **Integrated into:**

- **Material Icons fixes** → Task 36 (Performance optimization)
- **Repository method implementations** → Task 40 (Health data sync)
- **Database DAO methods** → Task 40 (Health data sync)
- **When expression fixes** → Task 36 (Performance optimization)
