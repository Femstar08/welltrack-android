# Meal Planning System Implementation

## Overview

Task 10: Implement meal planning system has been completed with full integration into the authenticated WellTrack application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Weekly Meal Planner UI with Calendar View ✅

- **MealPlanScreen**: Main screen with weekly calendar navigation
- **WeekCalendarView**: Interactive calendar showing meal completion status
- **CalendarDayCard**: Individual day cards with meal indicators
- **WeekNavigationRow**: Navigation between weeks

### 2. Automated Meal Plan Generation ✅

- **MealPlanGenerationRequest**: Request model for meal plan generation
- **MealPlanGenerationResult**: Response model with success/error handling
- **Recipe filtering**: Based on cooking time preferences and dietary restrictions
- **Smart recipe selection**: Matches recipes to meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- **Preference-based generation**: Uses user preferences for meal planning

### 3. Manual Meal Plan Override Functionality ✅

- **PlannedMeal editing**: Update recipes, servings, and notes
- **Custom meal addition**: Add meals without recipes
- **Meal replacement**: Replace planned meals with different recipes
- **Meal deletion**: Remove planned meals from the schedule
- **Status tracking**: Mark meals as completed, skipped, or in progress

### 4. Meal Prep Scheduling and Optimization ✅

- **MealPrepSchedule**: Optimized scheduling for meal preparation
- **MealPrepTask**: Individual prep tasks with time estimates
- **Cooking method grouping**: Groups recipes by cooking method (baking, grilling, etc.)
- **Time optimization**: Calculates total prep time and provides recommendations
- **Priority system**: High/Medium/Low priority for prep tasks

## Architecture Components

### Data Layer

- **MealPlan**: Entity for weekly meal plans
- **PlannedMeal**: Entity for individual planned meals
- **PlannedSupplement**: Entity for planned supplements
- **MealPlanDao**: Database access object with comprehensive queries
- **MealPlanRepositoryImpl**: Repository implementation with meal plan generation logic

### Domain Layer

- **MealPlanRepository**: Repository interface defining all meal plan operations
- **MealPlanningUseCase**: Business logic for meal planning operations
- **MealPrepSchedule**: Data classes for meal prep optimization

### Presentation Layer

- **MealPlanViewModel**: State management with real authentication integration
- **MealPlanScreen**: Main UI with calendar and navigation
- **DailyMealPlanView**: Detailed daily view with meal cards
- **MealPlanDialogs**: Preferences, meal prep schedule, and add meal dialogs

## Database Integration

- Added MealPlan, PlannedMeal, and PlannedSupplement entities to WellTrackDatabase
- Updated database version from 4 to 5
- Added MealPlanDao to DatabaseModule
- Full Room database integration with relationships

## Authentication Integration

- **Real user authentication**: MealPlanViewModel uses AuthRepository for current user
- **User-specific data**: All meal plans are tied to authenticated users
- **Authenticated navigation**: Meal planning integrated into main authenticated app flow
- **Profile-based planning**: Meal plans are user-specific and secure

## UI/UX Features

- **Material Design 3**: Consistent design with app theme
- **Interactive calendar**: Visual meal completion indicators
- **Meal status tracking**: Visual indicators for completed/skipped meals
- **Nutrition summaries**: Daily nutrition breakdown display
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators during operations

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: MealPlanningUseCaseTest with comprehensive test coverage
- **Repository tests**: MealPlanRepositoryImplTest for data layer validation
- **Mock data**: Proper mocking for isolated testing
- **Edge cases**: Error handling and empty state testing

## Navigation Integration

- **AuthenticatedApp**: Proper navigation flow for authenticated users
- **Screen transitions**: Smooth navigation between meal planning and other features
- **Back navigation**: Proper back stack management
- **Deep linking ready**: Structure supports future deep linking implementation

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Clean Architecture

- Separation of concerns with clear layer boundaries
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Use cases for business logic encapsulation

### 2. State Management

- StateFlow for reactive UI updates
- Proper error and loading state handling
- User authentication state integration

### 3. Database Design

- Normalized schema with proper relationships
- Efficient queries for meal plan operations
- Support for complex meal planning scenarios

### 4. User Experience

- Offline-first approach with local database
- Optimistic UI updates
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Future Enhancements Ready

The implementation is designed to support future enhancements:

- AI-powered meal recommendations
- Integration with shopping lists (Task 13)
- Pantry management integration (Task 14)
- Nutrition tracking integration
- Social sharing features
- Advanced meal prep optimization
